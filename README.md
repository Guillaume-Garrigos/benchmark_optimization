# benchmark_optimization

This is for running benchmarks between optimization solvers. Enmphasis is put on making it easy to add new methods.


Edit `config.py` to specify which solvers to run, with which parameters.

Run it with `python run.py` or `bash run.sh`

You first need to load some data sets in `/datasets/`, with the .txt extension. See [LibSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html).
